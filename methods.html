            <h2> Introduction:</h2>
            
            <h4> What is political polarization? </h4>
            <p> <ul>Political polarization is the <b>divergence of individual attitudes</b> from a central point towards extreme edges (far right or far left). The idea of polarization keeps changing based on context and country. For instance, In the <b>United States (US)</b>, polarization is used for assessment of candidates ideologies with respect to <b> amount of influence </b> they wield on the voters. Due to two-party system (<b> Democrat Vs. Republican </b>) in the US, political polarization is widely studied. As a result, the bulk of literature quantifying the qualitative information of opinions is produced in the US.<sup><a href = "#Grechyna">[1]</a></sup> In the <b> United Kingdom (UK)</b>, polarization is used to assess <b>policy acceptance rate</b> and predict trends when a referendum is passed.</p>

            <h4> How political polarization is measured? </h4>
            <p><ul> However, political polarization is measured on <b> qualitative information either collected from survey data or a questionnaire </b>. The questionnaire consists of <b> set of statements </b> for which the participants have to select <b> one opinion </b> from the following <b> strongly agree, agree, neither agree nor disagree, disagree, strongly agree </b>. Therefore, each opinion is encoded with values in the form of a <b> diverging scale</b>. Following encoding, the sentiments are investigated using statistical models. The following graphic depicts how favorite media and their target audience changes based on political polarization.</p>

            <h4> Why measure it? </h4>
            <p><ul> Political Polarization is associated with <b> social tensions, policy uncertainity, economic fluctuations, low economic growth rates.</b><sup>[1]</sup> Therefore, it is important to measure polarization as it might lead to <b> public unrest, riots, public property damages, mistrust </b> on policies. The conceptualization for <b>Polaris Lab UK</b> is motivated from the paper titled <b>"Political Polarization in the UK: Measures and socio-economic correlates"</b> by <b>Daryna Grechyna</b>.<sup><a href = "#Grechyna">[1]</a></sup></ul>

            <h2>Data:</h2>

            <p><ul>Data is downloaded from the <a href="https://beta.ukdataservice.ac.uk/datacatalogue/studies/study?id=5151#!/access-data"> UK data service portal</a>. The interactive map is designed on British Household Panel Survey (BHPS) data collected from 1991 – 2009. Each year is referred to as a "wave" And data starts from Wave 1 (1991) and ends with Wave 18 (2009).  Our analysis is focued on three years of data - 1995, 2000, 2004, as they contain survey for same statements, which is referred as "study period". We have capitalized our analysis based on one column which has spatial information.

            <h2>Methods and Analysis: </h2>

            <p><ul> Grechyna (2022) applied normalizations to derive values for potential determinants of political polarization<sup><a href = "#Grechyna">[1]</a></sup>. The variables used as part of analysis are : 
                <ul>
                <li><b>Standard Deviation of Age</b> : Standard deviation of age by region.</li>
                <li><b>Native Share Variability</b> : Share of non-applicable count in a region to total count is computed for each region.</li>
                <li><b>Education Variability</b> : Each respondent's education is encoded to a value based on documentation provided by <abbr title="British Household Panel Survey">BHPS</abbr>. And their share is calculated based on dissimilarity index for each region.</li>
                <li><b>Job Variability</b>: Each respondent's job is encoded to a value based on documentation provided by <abbr title="British Household Panel Survey">BHPS</abbr>. And their share is calculated based on dissimilarity index for each region. </li>
                <li><b>Fraction of Employed</b>: Count of full-time employed to total count in each region</li>
                <li><b>Median Income</b>: Median income in Pounds is computed for each region</li>
                <li><b>Gini Index of Income Inequality</b>: From income, Gini index is computed for each region.</li>
                </ul> <br>
                
            Therefore, trends and correlates are evaluated on a regional basis (group by "region" is applied) - Dissimilarity Index and Gini Index of income inequality are used to distribute weights of each group type.</ul></p>

            <p><ul>The political polarization measured in our study is based on three statements (S1, S2, S3) spread across study years (1995, 2000, 2004). Meaning, opinions on the same set of statements are recorded for each year in study years.<sup><a href = "#Grechyna">[1]</a></sup></ul></p>

            <p><ul><ul>
                <li> <b>Statement 1:</b> “Private enterprise is the best way to solve Britain’s economic problems.”</li>
                <li><b>Statement 2:</b> “Major public services and industries ought to be in state ownership.”</li>
                <li><b>Statement 3:</b> “It is the government’s responsibility to provide a job for everyone who wants one.”</li>
            </ul></ul></p>

            <p><ul>Furthermore, the political climate is analyzed and calculated by adopting three calculations: (The following are simplified meanings of each method and true definitions vary)</ul></p> 
            
            <ul><p>
                <li> <b>Lindqvist and Ostling (2010):</b> The variance of encoded opinions is calculated for each region to understand the deviation and distribution of opinions for each statement. Therefore, it calculates variance of opinions.<sup><a href = "#Lindqvist">[2]</a></sup></li>
                <img src = "https://github.com/gangaraju09/Geog_575_Final_Project/blob/main/img/lind.png?raw=true">
            </ul></p>

            <ul><p>
                <li><b>Abramowitz and Saunders (2008):</b> Calculated based on ideological distances of encoded opinions for each region, i.e., performing a mean using the absolute sum of values for each statement.<sup><a href = "#Abramowitz">[3]</a></sup></li>
                <img src = "https://github.com/gangaraju09/Geog_575_Final_Project/blob/main/img/ab.png?raw=true">
            </p></ul>

            <ul><p>
                <li><b>Duca and Saving (2016): </b> Calculated based on effective antagonisms across different social groups, i.e., computing the share of each group (weight calculations) and multiplying the share against squares of every other group with encoded opinion value for each region.<sup><a href = "Duca">[4]</a></sup></li>
                <img src = "https://github.com/gangaraju09/Geog_575_Final_Project/blob/main/img/duca.png?raw=true">
            </p></ul>

            <ul><p>Only valid opinions are considered and are encoded as {Strongly agree: 2, Agree: 1, Neither agree nor disagree: 0, Disagree: -1, Strongly Disagree: -2}. For more understanding of formulas displayed, please refer to the paper in references section. Moreover, from animation below, it is evident that share of milder opinions reduced but stronger opinions stayed consistent.Hence, there is huge scope to explore and understand driving forces that alter opinions.</p></ul>

            </p>

            <p><ul>
                Three polarization measures are correlated to an extent (about 80%) for study period. Major trends are: there is a positive correlation between political polarization with job status variability. There is a negative correlation between polarization with an increase in employment rate and the share of natives.
            </p></ul>

            <p><ul>
                Interestingly, job status variability and education variability are strongly positively correlated in the analyzed years. From this, we can understand there are fewer indivudual with entrepreneurship capabilities or lower encouragement from the government for entrepreneurship.
